Setting up SSL for DrakonHub
----------------------------

DrakonHub is based on a web server that does not support SSL.
In a production environment, SSL is necessary for security purposes.

To enable SSL, install an industry-grade web server with SSL support, for example nginx or Apache.
If you choose nginx, you could use our example configuration file, nginx.example.conf.

Install the web server
======================
Follow your the installation instruction for your web server


Obtain an SSL certificate for you server
========================================
For example, here https://zerossl.com/


Configure the web server
========================
See nginx.example.conf for details.


Configure DrakonHub
===================
Open /etc/tarantool/instances.available/onprem.lua

Find these lines:
behind_https = false
insecure_cookie = true

and change them to:
behind_https = true
insecure_cookie = false


Block non-SSL access to DrakonHub
=================================
Close port 8090 from external access.
